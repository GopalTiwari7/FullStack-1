        <p style="background-color: limegreen;text-align: justify;">Bootstrap is a potent front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions.Do not use Bootstrap. No, really don't. You can do better, you can design better, and you can build your code better. Using a CSS preprocessor like Sass will allow you to still have the rapid prototyping you need, and the community tools within Sass will be your bread and butter in this regard.</p>
