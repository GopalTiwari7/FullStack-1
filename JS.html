        <p style="text-align: justify;background-color: lightslategrey;">JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxe.JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things. That's what makes JavaScript unique. That's why it's the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces. That said, JavaScript also allows to create servers, mobile applications, etc.</p>
